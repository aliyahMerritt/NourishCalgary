                    Nourish Calgary is an app inspired by the graduating class of 2023 at Bowness High school and their Community Pantry legacy project. In the front of Bowness High School is a community pantry - designed and built by graduating 2023 students to combat food insecurity in their community.
                    With this app, Calgarians can view and be taken to community pantryâ€™s and free food, including food bank locations, etc. to help people stay nourished no matter their circumstances.
